# bulldozer_regression

In this notebook, we go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. The model is trained using time series data.
The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.
